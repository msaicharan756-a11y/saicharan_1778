Below is the Abstract and Functional Requirements for your Vehicle Management System program.


---

✅ ABSTRACT

The Vehicle Management System is a simple C program designed to store, display, and search information about vehicles. It uses a structure to represent each vehicle with attributes such as vehicle number, model, and owner name. An array of structures is used to manage multiple vehicle records. The program provides a menu-driven interface that allows users to add new vehicles, view all stored vehicle details, and search for a specific vehicle using its number. This system demonstrates basic concepts of C programming such as structures, arrays, functions, and loops, and is useful for maintaining and retrieving small-scale vehicle records efficiently.
